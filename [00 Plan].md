## Is the Productivity of a Scrum Team Over Time Autoregressive? 

### Chapter 1: The Productivity Paradox in Scrum: Unlocking the Hidden Dynamics of Team Performance

* **Introduction:**
    * **The Agile Revolution and the Rise of Scrum:**  Introduce the concept of Agile methodologies, emphasizing Scrum's popularity and its promise of increased productivity.
    * **The Productivity Paradox:**  Highlight the apparent contradiction:  Scrum is designed to enhance productivity, yet many teams struggle to consistently achieve high performance.
    * **The Missing Piece: Autoregressive Dynamics:**  Introduce the concept of autoregression as a potential explanation for the observed fluctuations in Scrum team productivity.  Explain how understanding these patterns could unlock insights into team performance and predictability.
    * **Research Question:**  
        *  **Does the productivity of a Scrum team exhibit autoregressive characteristics over time?**
        *  **If so, what are the implications for team performance, predictability, and strategic management?** 

* **Understanding Scrum:**
    *  **The Scrum Framework:**  Provide a concise overview of the Scrum framework, emphasizing its core elements (Sprints, roles, events, artifacts).
    * **Measuring Productivity in Scrum:**  Discuss common metrics used to gauge Scrum team productivity (velocity, story points, task completion rate). Analyze their strengths and limitations.
    * **Factors Influencing Productivity:**  Explore various factors that impact Scrum team performance, including team size, experience, team composition, complexity of tasks, and organizational context.

* **Autoregressive Processes: A Window into Time-Dependent Data:**
    * **The Concept of Autoregression:**  Explain the fundamental concept of autoregressive processes in time series analysis.  Use clear examples to illustrate how the value of a variable at a given time depends on its previous values.
    * **Applications of Autoregression:**  Highlight the use of autoregressive models in various fields, including economics, finance, and social science.  
    * **Potential Insights for Scrum Teams:**  Explain how applying autoregressive analysis to Scrum team productivity data could unveil hidden patterns and relationships. 

### Chapter 2: Uncovering the Patterns: A Rigorous Approach to Data Analysis

* **Data Collection and Selection:**
    * **Data Sources:**  Discuss various sources of historical Scrum team productivity data, such as project management tools (Jira, Asana), team retrospective logs, and interviews with team members.
    * **Data Selection Criteria:**  Define the criteria used to select relevant data for analysis.  Consider factors like team size, project duration, and data quality.
    * **Time Frame and Data Granularity:**  Justify the chosen time frame for analysis and the level of data granularity (e.g., daily, weekly, Sprint-based).

* **Statistical Analysis and Modeling:**
    * **Time Series Analysis Techniques:**  Introduce key time series analysis techniques relevant to autoregression, including autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and ARIMA modeling. 
    * **Assessing Autoregressive Relationships:**  Describe the statistical methods used to identify and quantify autoregressive relationships within the Scrum team data.  
    * **Addressing Potential Biases:**  Discuss potential biases that could influence the results and explain the strategies used to mitigate their impact.  
    * **Case Study:  A Deep Dive into a Real-World Scrum Team:**  Present a detailed analysis of a specific Scrum team's data, highlighting the application of the methodology and the insights gleaned.

* **Ethical Considerations:**
    * **Data Privacy and Confidentiality:**  Explain the steps taken to ensure data privacy and confidentiality, including data anonymization and informed consent protocols.
    * **Transparency and Reporting:**  Discuss the ethical implications of reporting research findings and the importance of avoiding misleading or biased representations of the data.

### Chapter 3:  Productivity Unlocked:  Implications, Strategies, and the Future of Scrum
